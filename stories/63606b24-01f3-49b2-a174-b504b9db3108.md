# Makers Valley – Nando’s transforms a community
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/63606b24-01f3-49b2-a174-b504b9db3108/images/63606b24-01f3-49b2-a174-b504b9db3108.webp)

In Johannesburg's Lorentzville, an old building that was empty for a long time has been turned into Victoria Yards, a lively urban spot that focuses on helping the community and growing businesses. This busy area is both a business project and a sign of hope for the people living nearby.

The areas around Lorentzville, like Bertrams and Troyeville, had issues like illegal dumping, neglected public spaces, and not many chances for young people. The community needed a safe place and resources to help people grow personally and professionally, and to make the area cleaner and safer.

Victoria Yards became a solution, turning the area into a busy place with small businesses and a popular spot for visitors. One of the creative groups is the NGO Makers Valley, which helps improve the community.

So how did they do it?
- **Resource centre:** Makers Valley offers a drop-in resource centre with free access to computers, WiFi, and advice for job seekers. They also have a podcast studio with sound and visual tools, along with skills development programs in STEM and coding.
- **Urban rangers:** The team, called urban rangers, looks after the area by cleaning stormwater drains, removing illegal dumping, and taking care of public spaces. They work with Jeppe SAPS to watch crime hotspots and make the area safer.
- **Funding:** The rangers get paid by the Social Employment Fund (SEF) through the Joburg Inner City Partnership, giving them an income and easing the financial load on Makers Valley.
- **Community impact:** By teaming up with different organizations, Makers Valley has improved the streets around Victoria Yards and positively changed the lives of many young people.
