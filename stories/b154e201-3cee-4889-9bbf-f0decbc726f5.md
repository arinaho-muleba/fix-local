A recent event in KZN shows how teamwork between local police and neighbourhood watch groups can make a big difference. Their cooperation led to the arrest of a suspect in a home invasion, highlighting the importance of community alertness and working together.

>“A vigilant member of the local Neighbourhood Watch had identified a suspect, who was captured on CCTV footage, and who had stolen valuable items and an undisclosed amount of cash from the property."

Multiple Armed Response Officers and members of security company's Special Operations Team were immediately dispatched to the scene.

>“Upon arrival, our officers spotted the individual matching the suspect’s description from the CCTV footage and immediately apprehended him.” 

It was also further established that the suspect was wanted in connection with a case of trespassing and malicious damage to property in October last year.

## What was the problem?
Home invasions are a big concern in many South African areas, making people feel unsafe. In a recent case, a suspect was spotted by a sharp-eyed member of a local neighbourhood watch group. The suspect had been involved in a housebreaking incident the week before, stealing valuable items and cash. The alert was sent through a WhatsApp Crime Alert Group, leading to quick action.

## How did they solve it?
After the home invasion, local police teamed up with neighbourhood watch groups to find the suspect. This teamwork was very effective because their shared resources and information led to a quick arrest. The neighbourhood watch groups were important because they gave timely information and support to the police.

So how did they do it?
- Neighbourhood watch groups stayed in constant contact with the police, sharing any suspicious activities or leads.
- Regular patrols and being more watchful in the area helped stop more crimes.
- The police and neighbourhood watch groups worked together, making sure information and resources flowed smoothly.
- By working together, the police and the community quickly caught the suspect.

## Strengthening community safety
Do you have a neighbourhood watch group in your area? Working with local police can greatly improve community safety. Consider joining or forming a neighbourhood watch group to help protect your community.
