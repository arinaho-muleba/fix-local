In a big move to help Durban's homeless people, Advance Access & Delivery South Africa has joined forces with Viva Con Agua to bring mobile hygiene units to the Bellhaven Harm Reduction Centre.


## What was the problem?
Since it opened in 2020, the Bellhaven Harm Reduction Centre in Greyville has been a key place for homeless people, starting as a drug withdrawal program during the Covid-19 crisis. Even though it has helped over 2,000 people, the centre struggled to provide clean water and basic hygiene services.


## How did they solve it?
To tackle the urgent need for better hygiene facilities, Advance Access & Delivery South Africa worked with Viva Con Agua to start the Nina Manzi project. This project aims to give fair access to clean water and hygiene through mobile units.

So how did they do it?
- **Working Together:** The partnership between the two groups was important, as they both focus on community health and welfare.
- **Mobile Units:** The mobile units are designed to look good and work well, with colourful designs and useful features.
- **Complete Features:** Each unit has four shower stalls and two toilet cubicles, with shower gel, toilet paper, and features for people with mobility challenges.
- **Maintenance:** The units are cleaned after each use to keep them nice and clean for everyone.

Michael Wilson, director of Advance Access & Delivery SA, praised the partnerships, noting their role in serving over two thousand people in Durban. Phumelele Muthali from Viva Con Agua highlighted the project's aim to restore dignity, ensuring that users have everything they need on-site.
