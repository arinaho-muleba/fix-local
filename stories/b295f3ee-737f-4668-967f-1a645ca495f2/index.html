<p><em>Imagine Johannesburg with parks that are safe for families and kids. This dream is becoming real with a new plan to change inner-city parks.</em></p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Johannesburg doesn't have enough open spaces and parks for its growing population. This lack has made the existing parks overused and damaged, making them unsafe and unattractive. End Street North Park in Doornfontein, once an industrial area, has been hit hard, becoming a spot for illegal activities like gambling and drug dealing.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>The End Street North Park upgrade is a new effort to make a safe, welcoming, and lasting public space. The plan brings together city departments and community members to work together to design and manage the park. The goal is to create a management plan for city development that can be used in other parts of Johannesburg and beyond.</p>
<p>So how did they do it?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Current Reality:</strong> They did surveys, site visits, and needs checks to choose End Street North Park as the first site.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitating Key Stakeholder Brainstorming Sessions:</strong> They held planning and design meetings, made a team, and created a project plan.</li>
<li><strong>Project Mapping, Carrying Out, and Management:</strong> Defined roles and responsibilities, engaged Sticky Situations for stakeholder mapping, and initiated data collection and assessments.</li>
<li><strong>Pilot: Case Study:</strong> They checked safety, held MineCraft sessions for public input, and set up community events to bring life to the park.</li>
<li><strong>Carrying Out Plan:</strong> Developed key interventions and suggestions, mapped current and proposed institutional models, and proposed a governance model for park management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we have achieved</h2>
<p>The project has successfully involved the community through various activities, including a MineCraft workshop and weekend events like &quot;Meet your Neighbour&quot; and a boxing tournament. These activities have helped residents feel ownership, which has positively affected the planning and design phase of the park upgrade. A draft design of the park has been created, and the community will continue to be engaged in the implementation phase.</p>
<h2>What we have learned</h2>
<p>While the project aims to greatly improve the neighborhood, several challenges have come up, like different opinions among park users, limited cooperation from community members, and funding limits. Despite these challenges, working together on the design has been helpful. It has made people feel ownership, which reduces vandalism and illegal activities, saving resources and bringing people together.</p>
