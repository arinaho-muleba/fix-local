In South Africa, load shedding happens a lot and can cause issues for homes and businesses. By taking simple steps, you can protect your electronic devices and keep your home safe during power cuts. Here are twelve easy tips to help you deal with load shedding without using generators or solar panels.

## Steps to Get Ready for Load Shedding

1. **Stay Updated:** Keep track of planned power cuts by downloading a reliable Eskom load shedding app or joining a group that shares updates.

2. **Boost Security:** Be aware that criminals might take advantage of load shedding schedules. Make sure your home is secure and check for weak spots.

3. **Install Backup Batteries:** Ensure your alarm and gate systems have working backup batteries to keep security during outages.

4. **Prepare Backup Lighting:** Keep a torch or headlamp in your car for nighttime outages. Use your phone's torch feature for sudden blackouts.

5. **Charge Devices:** Make sure your electronic devices are fully charged before outages and recharge them quickly once power is back. Have a power bank ready for long outages.

6. **Stay Connected:** Keep your mobile data topped up to stay informed and connected during outages. Use devices carefully to save battery life.

7. **Use Gas:** Get a small gas bottle for cooking and lighting. A gas lamp can light up large areas, and a gas cooker is useful during power cuts.

8. **Store Bottled Water:** Freeze bottled water to keep food cold during outages and ensure you have enough water if your supply depends on electric pumps.

9. **Keep Food Cold:** Keep fridge and freezer doors closed to maintain temperatures. A full freezer can keep food safe for up to two days.

10. **Unplug Electronics:** Unplug devices during power cuts to prevent damage when the power returns.

11. **Backup Data:** Use online services to save important data from your home computer to prevent data loss.

12. **Have Emergency Contacts Ready:** Save emergency numbers on your phone and have a printed copy, including contacts for emergency services and insurance information.

## Planning for Electric Surges

Electric surges can damage home equipment during outages. Consider using surge protectors on your electrical board or power outlets. Ask an electrician for advice and help with installation.
