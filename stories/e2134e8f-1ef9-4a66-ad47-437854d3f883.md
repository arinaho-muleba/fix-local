# Goboti's green revolution: a model for food security

In the Eastern Cape village of Goboti, a community project makes sure that everyone has enough to eat. Led by Reverend Gcobani Vika, the village has become a shining example of self-sufficiency and farming success.


## What was the problem?
Goboti, like many rural areas, faced issues like substance abuse and economic hardship. The rising cost of living made these problems worse, making food security a big worry for the village's 700 households.


## How did they solve it?
Reverend Gcobani Vika, a local Methodist leader, led a plan to improve Goboti. He turned down a PhD opportunity to invest in his community, leading to the creation of Friends of Goboti. The village focused on rebuilding things like the church and classrooms and solving social problems through sports and community activities.

The community started focusing on farming, using their good soil and mountain water. They launched a "green revolution," encouraging every household to grow their own gardens. The project not only provided food but also created jobs and made people less dependent on food parcels.

Key steps included:
- Checking skills and using local youth for building projects.
- Giving 20% of farming profits to landowners and the rest to workers.
- Collecting money from households to keep a new tractor working, allowing more land to be farmed.

The village's work has caught the eye of other areas, with visitors keen to learn from their success. Plans are being made to set up processing places to keep money benefits in the community.
