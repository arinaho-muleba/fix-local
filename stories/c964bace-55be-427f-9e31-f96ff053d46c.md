# Benoni community gets together to make things beautiful

![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/c964bace-55be-427f-9e31-f96ff053d46c/images/c964bace-55be-427f-9e31-f96ff053d46c.webp)

A determined community in Gauteng decided to fix their town themselves.

## What was the problem?
The corner of Pretoria Road and Fifth Avenue in Benoni was overgrown and messy, showing a bigger problem of urban decay. The community decided to organise themselves and take action to create the environment they wanted for their families to enjoy.
## How did they solve it?
Jonathan Etherington, unhappy with the corner's state, started Clean Projects in December 2022. He believed that "small actions can create big changes" and got more than 50 volunteers to help make a difference.

So how did they do it?
- The team started by cutting the grass and making a water-saving bed of succulent plants.
- They found other areas that needed help and, with support from sponsors, partners, and volunteers, worked on more than 10 kilometres of road and nearby parks.
- They planted, painted, cleaned, and weeded to make the area look better.

The community quickly saw big improvements and got strong local support. Clean Projects hired a full-time worker to keep up their progress.

Alison, Jonathan’s wife and project leader, talked about the importance of community involvement: “We want to inspire others to act and make change. It’s the little things that count, and together we can make a big difference. We hope the initiative will encourage communities and businesses to adopt these areas to ensure that it remains in a good condition and build on to what we started. We want the community to take ownership of the city, truly making our home a place to be proud of.”
