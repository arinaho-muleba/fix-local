# From gang den to sport haven: a community transformation

In Vereeniging, a park that was once full of crime is now a busy sports hub. This change happened because of a local businessman's hard work and help from the community.

  
## What was the problem?  
Vereeniging Park was a place where crime was common. Drug users and gangsters were often there. The park was left in bad shape for over ten years, with no proper fence or upkeep, which made crime worse in the area.

  
## How did they solve it?  
Xolani Mathumbo, the CEO of Remember Elite Sport Academy, decided to fix the park. He was upset that local leaders did not act, so he gathered community members and sponsors to change the park into a modern sports place.

So how did they do it?
- They built a 1.3-kilometre wall around the park, which helped lower crime.
- The park now has green fields, seats for fans, a gym, and homes for players and staff.
- Mathumbo used his own money and his mother's savings to start the project.
- The academy helps more than 280 young athletes. It gives them sports training and pays school fees for many.
- Eight players have become professionals because of the project, including a 16-year-old who joined Supersport United.

Mathumbo says private-public partnerships are important. He says, "A private-public partnership can only work if we understand that the government can’t do everything and, as citizens, we must play our part."

  
## Supporting community initiatives  
Mathumbo asks companies to help with community projects and sports activities. He thanks the sponsors and encourages more companies to get involved to keep the academy growing.
