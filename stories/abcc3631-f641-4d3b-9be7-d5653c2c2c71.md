# South Africa's waste pickers are worth gold to us

In the busy city of Johannesburg, informal waste pickers play a big role in recycling, but they face many challenges and stigma. These people, often ignored, are key to the city's waste management and environmental efforts.

  
## What was the problem?  
In Johannesburg, informal waste pickers like Thembekile Mokoena face daily struggles as they move through the city's socio-economic divides. Even though they recycle up to 90% of plastic and packaging, people often see them as a problem, and security guards harass them. Without formal recognition and support, they are open to mistreatment and stigma from society.

  
## How did they solve it?  
People are working to include waste pickers more in the city's recycling system. Groups like Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) are fighting for their rights and starting projects to protect them from harassment. The Department of Environmental Affairs has made rules to make their work official, including signing up and paying them for their services. In some communities, talks between residents and reclaimers are helping people respect and understand each other, slowly changing how people see them and making more welcoming places.
