<p>Plastic waste is a big problem for the environment and health worldwide. Even though people try to recycle, a lot of plastic still ends up in landfills in South Africa. This waste harms the environment and is a missed chance to save resources.</p>
<p>Some South African women have found new ways to use plastic waste, helping their communities:</p>

Lynn Worsley started All Women Recycling in Cape Town to cut down on plastic waste and help women. The group turns old plastic bottles into eco-friendly gift boxes and teaches women business and sales skills.</p>
