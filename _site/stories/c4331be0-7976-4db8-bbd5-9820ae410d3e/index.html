<p>The Wilds in Johannesburg used to be a scary place, but now it is a lively community park because of one person's hard work.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>The Wilds, a park in Johannesburg, was known for being unsafe. Local people stayed away because they were scared of crime and neglect. The park was overgrown, with broken benches, crumbling walls, and paths that were not looked after. Even the park workers were scared to go deep into the park.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>James Delaney, an artist who lives nearby, decided to take back The Wilds. At first, he was unsure, but he started walking in the park with his dog, Pablo, and soon saw what it could become. Delaney took over the park in 2016 and started fixing it. He asked friends for help and raised money online, giving his art as rewards.</p>
<p>To bring people to the park, Delaney put 67 colourful metal owl sculptures all over, even though some thought they would be stolen. The owls were very popular, especially with children, and people shared them on social media. Delaney kept adding more sculptures and bright benches to make the park friendly.</p>
<p>Today, The Wilds gets 10,000 visitors each month. It is a safe and calm place in a city with many problems. Delaney's work has inspired more people to improve Johannesburg and other places.</p>
