## Understanding the impact of poor road markings and signs
Bad road markings and signs can cause confusion and accidents, putting everyone on the road in danger. Clear road signs and markings help guide drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. They make traffic flow smoothly and reduce the risk of crashes.

## Steps to improve road markings and signs

**Materials and tools needed:**
- Bright paint: For repainting faded road markings.
- Reflective tape: To make signs more visible at night.
- Sign materials: For replacing or putting up new road signs.
- Safety gear: Like gloves, goggles, and bright vests.

**Procedure:**

1. **Check the area:** Find parts of the road where markings are faded or signs are missing or broken.

2. **Plan the changes:** Decide what markings and signs are needed by looking at traffic patterns and safety needs.

3. **Get permissions:** Ask local authorities for permission to make changes to public roads.

4. **Prepare the site:** Clear the area of rubbish and make sure it is safe to work.

5. **Paint new markings:** Paint over road lines and symbols with bright paint.

6. **Put up or replace signs:** Use strong materials and reflective tape so signs can be seen day and night.

7. **Review and adjust:** After putting up the signs and markings, check the area to see if they work well and make changes if needed.
