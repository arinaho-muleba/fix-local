<p>Oudtshoorn is making big moves to improve safety and services with the 'Fix Our Streetlights' campaign. This plan shows how good leadership and community help can make a difference.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Many streetlights in Oudtshoorn were broken, which made the streets unsafe and could lead to more crime. The lack of proper lighting worried people, affecting both those walking around and the overall feeling of safety in the area.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>Executive Mayor Johan Allers and the Government of Local Unity are leading the campaign to fix these issues. The plan focuses on public safety by making sure all streetlights work, which will improve the safety and well-being of everyone.</p>
<p>So how did they do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>The campaign gets the community involved by letting people report broken streetlights through a special phone line or the municipal Collab Citizen App.</li>
<li>A quick-response team is set up to fix problems fast, showing the municipality's commitment to public service.</li>
<li>The plan highlights the importance of working together, asking residents to help create a safer, well-lit environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this campaign, Oudtshoorn shows that making streets safer and improving services is not just a dream but a real goal that can be reached by working together.</p>
