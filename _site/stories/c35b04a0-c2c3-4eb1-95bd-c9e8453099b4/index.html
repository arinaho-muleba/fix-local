<p>Eskom is starting a big project to update millions of prepaid electricity meters across South Africa, making sure they work after November 2024.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Eskom needs to update 6.6 million prepaid electricity meters to make sure they keep working after 24 November 2024. This update is important to avoid any breaks in electricity for prepaid users.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>Don Taylor, who invented the first prepaid meter, is leading the project, which has a simple update process. Customers will get two special tokens with their regular electricity purchases, which they need to enter into their meters. Eskom has already updated 5,800 meters in a test program in Gauteng.</p>
<p>So how is the update being done?</p>
<ul>
<li>Eskom plans to update about 12,800 meters each day to meet the deadline.</li>
<li>Customers will get update tokens with their electricity purchases.</li>
<li>Eskom teams might visit homes to help with the update, or customers can enter the tokens themselves.</li>
<li>The update is free, and Eskom warns against people who might try to scam others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Positive results from municipalities</h2>
<p>Some municipalities, like Dr Beyers Naude, have finished their updates, leading to more money from electricity sales. This shows the project's ability to improve local services and finances.</p>
<h2>How you can stay informed</h2>
<p>Eskom is rolling out the updates in phases, focusing on different areas over time. Customers should keep informed through local news and community updates to know when their area will be updated.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>This update is an important step to make sure prepaid meters keep working. Eskom and local municipalities are dedicated to making the process smooth and efficient, promising a seamless transition and reliable service for all.</p>
