# Melville’s community road repair plan
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/eda051c7-06f3-46b0-8d3d-c7a5f41a2403/images/eda051c7-06f3-46b0-8d3d-c7a5f41a2403.webp)


In South Africa, potholes are a big problem for drivers. In the Johannesburg suburb of Melville, people have decided to fix the problem themselves.


## What was the problem?
The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has too many roads to fix, causing long delays. These delays make potholes more dangerous. In Melville, new potholes were being reported every week, showing that local roads were not being fixed. The situation needed quick action.


## How did they solve it?
Danyle Nunes, a Melville resident, decided to fix the bad road conditions. As an active member of community groups like the Melville Security Initiative and Melville Residents' Association, Nunes saw the need for a community-based solution. He started CREASS, a company focused on fixing local issues like potholes, litter, and missing road markings. CREASS helps the community work with the local government, making repairs faster, from months to days.

How did they do it?
- CREASS checks Melville's streets regularly.
- They record each pothole and report it to the JRA, making a list of repairs needed.
- If JRA is slow to respond, CREASS gets permits to do the repairs.
- They complete repairs using approved materials.
- CREASS is now working in nearby suburbs, helping communities to be strong and make changes.
