## Finding and fixing leaks

Leaks in your home or garden can be annoying and costly. Luckily, many leaks can be fixed with some basic know-how and tools. Before you start, it's important to find the leak and know how to turn off the water supply to that area.

### Reading your water meter

Knowing how to read your water meter is important for finding leaks. Most meters show water use with numbers. Usually, the meter is near your property's entrance or boundary, often in a ground-level hole covered by a metal plate.

### Checking for leaks

A high water bill might mean you have a leak. To check for leaks, make sure no water is used in your home for a while. Take an initial reading from your water meter, wait an hour, and then take another reading. If the readings are different, you might have a leak in your home or garden, especially if you have a hose or watering system.

### Starting leak repairs

Before fixing any leaks, find your water mains tap or main water tap, usually near the water meter. This tap controls the water to your home and should be turned off before fixing a leak. However, only close it when necessary, as changes in water pressure can damage pipes. If you are not sure how to fix a leak, it is best to ask a plumber.
