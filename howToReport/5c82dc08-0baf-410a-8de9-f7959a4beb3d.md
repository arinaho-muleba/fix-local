# How to escalate a fault report
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/5c82dc08-0baf-410a-8de9-f7959a4beb3d/images/5c82dc08-0baf-410a-8de9-f7959a4beb3d.webp)

*Read the steps below.* 

Then, to escalate, contact your Ward Councillor. To find out who the ward councillor is in the area where you are registered to vote, [visit](https://www.elections.org.za/pw/Voter/Who-Is-My-Ward-Councillor) 

Alternatively, the People’s Assembly [website](https://www.pa.org.za/) will find a councillor for any region in the country when you enter a physical address.

When you have issues or service disruptions, knowing how to report a problem can help. This guide gives steps to make sure your concerns are sorted out quickly and properly.

## Steps for reporting a problem

1. **Collect Information:**
   - Gather all important details about the issue, like dates, times, and any past chats or reference numbers.

2. **First Contact:**
   - Get in touch with the service provider's customer service team. Use their official ways to contact them, like phone, email, or online portals.

3. **Check Back:**
   - If the issue is not sorted, check back with the customer service team. Get a reference number of all chats for future use.

4. **Take It Higher - escalate to your Ward Councilor:**
   - If the issue continues, ask to speak with a supervisor or manager. Clearly explain the issue and provide all needed information.

How to find your Ward Councillor:
To find out who the ward councillor is in the area where you are registered to vote, [visit](https://www.elections.org.za/pw/Voter/Who-Is-My-Ward-Councillor) 

Alternatively, the People’s Assembly [website](https://www.pa.org.za/) will find a councillor for any region in the country when you enter a physical address.


5. **Make a Formal Complaint:**
   - If talking to customer service does not help, think about making a formal complaint. You can often do this on the company's website or by writing a letter.

6. **Get Outside Help:**
   - If internal steps do not work, get help from outside groups like consumer protection agencies or industry regulators.

## More information
For more help on reporting problems, contact local consumer protection agencies or industry-specific regulatory bodies for advice and support.
