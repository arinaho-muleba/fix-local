<p>Joburg, a city dealing with rundown areas and service issues, is seeing a new project to fix its main entry points. Jozi My Jozi is working to make the city safer, cleaner, and more vibrant.</p>
<p>Joburg has long struggled with problems like crime, bad services, and poor waste management. These issues have stuck around despite many efforts over the years. The city's main entry points, which are important for people coming in, have been ignored and have become shabby, making people think badly of the inner city.</p>
<p>Jozi My Jozi, together with the City of Joburg and various partners, has started a project to refresh the city's main entry points. The plan is to clean these areas, add plants, and make them safer, creating a welcoming space for everyone.</p>
<p>The project focuses on 10 key entry points, turning them into clean, safe, and inspiring places. They are putting in solar lights, rubbish bins, and CCTV cameras, along with bright murals and art. The project works with local authorities and private companies to keep the areas clean and safe. Businesses are encouraged to look after these entry points, helping to keep them beautiful and maintained.</p>
<p>Wayne Dawson, who leads the safety and security team, highlights the teamwork in improving these areas. The project not only fixes immediate problems but also prepares for long-term city improvement.</p>
