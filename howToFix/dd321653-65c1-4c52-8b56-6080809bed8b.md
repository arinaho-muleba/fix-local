*Community police forums (CPFs) help the police and communities work together. These forums help solve local safety problems and improve communication, making sure community needs are met.*

## Steps for starting your community police forum

1. Find out what the community needs:
   - Identify the specific safety problems in your area.
   - Talk to local residents to learn about their concerns.

2. Work with local authorities:
   - Contact the local police station to show interest in starting a CPF.
   - Work with police representatives to learn the legal steps to set up a forum.

3. Plan a community meeting:
   - Choose a date, time, and place for the first meeting to talk about starting the CPF.
   - Use flyers, community boards, and social media to invite residents.

4. Create a structure:
   - Choose a committee to lead the CPF, with roles like chairperson, secretary, and treasurer.
   - Create rules to guide the forum's work.

5. Register the forum:
   - Complete any needed registration with local authorities to make the CPF official.

6. Plan regular meetings:
   - Set regular meetings to talk about issues, plan activities, and check progress.
   - Make sure there is open communication between the community and the police.
