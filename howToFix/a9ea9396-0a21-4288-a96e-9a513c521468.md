# How does local government work
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/a9ea9396-0a21-4288-a96e-9a513c521468/images/a9ea9396-0a21-4288-a96e-9a513c521468.webp)

Local government in South Africa is important for running things. It provides key services and speaks for the community. There are 257 municipalities. Knowing how they work can help people and groups get involved with local government.

## key parts of local government

1. **structure of local government:**
   - South Africa's local government is split into eight metro, 44 district, and 205 local municipalities.
   - Each level has elected members, an executive committee, and departments with civil servants.

2. **roles and responsibilities:**
   - Municipalities provide services like electricity, water, sanitation, and waste removal.
   - They also look after local infrastructure, public transport, and recreational facilities.

3. **elections and representation:**
   - Councils are elected every five years. There are separate elections for metro and local councils.
   - In metro areas, voters choose parties and ward candidates. Local municipalities do the same.
   - District councils have a mix of directly elected and appointed councillors from local councils.

4. **engaging with local councillors:**
   - To find your ward councillor, visit the Electoral Commission's website. https://www.elections.org.za/pw/Voter/Who-Is-My-Ward-Councillor
   - The [People's Assembly website](https://www.pa.org.za/) helps you find councillors by entering a physical address. 

5. **accountability and involvement:**
   - Groups like Ground Up and Corruption Watch show you how to hold councillors accountable.
   - If you want to get more involved, think about joining a ward committee.
