<p>A major court decision in South Africa says air pollution breaks people's Constitutional rights, marking a big win for those fighting for a cleaner environment.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>People living in the Mpumalanga Highveld have been dealing with bad air pollution, which harms their health and well-being. Even though there is a plan to manage air quality in the Highveld Priority Area, the government's efforts have not been enough, leaving residents exposed to harmful air.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>Environmental groups, like groundWork and the Vukani Environmental Justice Movement in Action, took the government to court, asking for enforcement of air quality rules. With help from the Centre for Environmental Rights, they said the government's inaction broke the Constitutional right to a healthy environment. The Pretoria High Court ruled in their favour, ordering the government to enforce rules to improve air quality in the Highveld.</p>
<p>So how did they do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>The groups started the #DeadlyAir case in 2019, challenging the government's failure to fix air pollution.</li>
<li>They showed evidence of health impacts on communities, especially in the Highveld Priority Area.</li>
<li>The court found that the Environment Minister delayed necessary actions and ordered immediate use of the air quality management plan.</li>
<li>This ruling sets an example for holding the government responsible for air quality and protecting people's rights to clean air.</li>
