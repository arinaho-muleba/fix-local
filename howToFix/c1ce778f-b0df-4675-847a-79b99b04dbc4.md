## Finding a leaky toilet
A leaking toilet can waste a lot of water every day, from 130 to 750 litres, depending on how bad the leak is. Common causes include worn-out washers or seals. To check for leaks, add a few drops of food colouring or instant coffee to the cistern. If the colour shows up in the bowl without flushing, there is a leak. Other signs include water trickling down the bowl or strange sounds from an unused toilet.

## DIY toilet repair
Before you start any repair work, find and turn off the water mains tap or stopcock to stop the water flow. Toilets usually leak from three places: the outlet port, the side intake valve, and the filler float.

**Steps to fix common toilet leaks:**

1. **Fixing the outlet port washer:**
   - Remove the flush valve and unscrew the wing screws to take out the plunger washer.
   - Use a screwdriver to pry out the old washer from its groove.
   - Put in a new washer carefully and put the valve back together.

2. **Fixing the side intake valve washer:**
   - Unscrew the top of the intake valve.
   - Replace the old washer with a new one inside the valve.
   - Secure the valve top and turn the water back on to check if it works properly.

3. **Adjusting the filler float:**
   - Bend the floating arm connected to the filler float downward to reduce water entering the cistern.

These easy repairs can fix common leaks. For more difficult problems, call a professional plumber to avoid more damage.
