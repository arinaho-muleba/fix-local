Expressing your concerns through a letter or email to your local councillor or municipal office can be a strong way to address issues like bylaw violations. Writing a clear letter or petition helps make sure your voice is heard and can lead to solutions.

3. **Mention past reports:**
   - Talk about any past reports with their reference numbers to give context.

4. **Keep it short:**

5. **Use templates for help:**
   - Use sample letters to fit your specific issue, like reporting illegal activities or objecting to rezoning plans.

## Steps for drafting a petition

1. **Say what the issue is:**
   - Clearly say what the complaint or request is about.

2. **Suggest a solution:**
   - Describe the action or solution you want.
