A new programme in Gauteng is helping local sports clubs by giving them important equipment. This helps young athletes grow in sports and in their personal lives.

  
## What was the problem?  
Local sports clubs often don't have enough resources, which makes it hard for them to give good training and growth chances to young athletes. This lack of equipment and support can affect the clubs' ability to nurture talent and keep children engaged in positive activities.

  
## How did they solve it?  
10Bet, through its Gear-Up Ikasi programme, is solving this problem by giving sports kits to clubs that need them. Recently, they provided football and netball kits to the Ivory Development Academy in Orlando East. This programme aims to equip local sports clubs with essential gear, enabling them to offer better training and playing conditions.

So how did they do it?
- 10Bet works with sports clubs all over Gauteng.
- Clubs can ask for kits by sending a video and reason on 10Bet's Facebook page.
- Winners are picked by chance each month, making sure resources are shared fairly.

Mbongeni Zondo, the chairman and coach of Ivory Development Academy, talked about the challenges of working with children from different backgrounds. He emphasized the importance of sports in providing structure and opportunities for personal growth. Zondo dreams of his soccer team competing internationally and producing professional players.

Silindile Khumbane, a netball player at the academy, shared how being part of the team has helped her life, keeping her active and away from bad influences.

Andile Ncube from SABC Sports and 10Bet thanked the community for their support and recognised the role of parents in the academy's success.
