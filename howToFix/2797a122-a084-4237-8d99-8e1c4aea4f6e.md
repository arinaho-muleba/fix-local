Creating change in your community needs planning and action. Whether you're fixing local problems, forming groups, or working with media, these steps will help you make a real difference.

## Steps for organising and creating change

1. **Reporting issues to the municipality:**
   - Clearly explain the problem, whether it is about services or infrastructure.
   - Find the right municipal department by looking at their website or calling their office.
   - Send your complaint online, through an app, or in person, with detailed information and proof.
   - Keep your complaint number and check back often.

2. **Escalating issues to your ward councillor:**
   - Find out who your ward councillor is via the municipal website or office.
   - Get all the important papers ready for your case.
   - Contact your councillor by email, phone, or in person, and explain your issue clearly.
   - Go to ward meetings to talk about your issue and get support.

3. **Setting up a street WhatsApp group:**
   - Collect phone numbers of interested residents.
   - Create a WhatsApp group and add the contacts.
   - Make rules to keep talks on topic and respectful.
   - Use the group to share updates and organise meetings.

4. **Establishing a residents' or ratepayers' association:**
   - Gauge interest from neighbours in forming an association.
   - Write a plan that explains the group's purpose and setup.
   - Choose leaders like a chairperson, secretary, and treasurer.
   - Register the association with the relevant authorities if necessary.

   - Collaborate with local police for guidance and support.
   - Set up steps for reporting suspicious activities.
   - Promote safety through meetings and communication channels.

6. **Joining or setting up a community policing forum (CPF):**
   - Learn about the CPF’s structure and objectives by contacting local authorities.
   - Join an existing CPF or express interest in setting up a new one.
   - Get the community to join and help with the CPF.
   - Hold meetings to talk about stopping crime and safety.

7. **Organising for change:**

   - Find local media that talks about community issues.
   - Reach out to journalists with your story and offer interviews or materials.
   - Share your story on social media and encourage others to spread the word.
   - Keep media contacts updated on the situation.
