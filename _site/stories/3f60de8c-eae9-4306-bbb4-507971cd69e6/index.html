<p>Delta Park's dam is covered by water hyacinth, a harmful plant that spreads fast. The local community and researchers are working together to fix this environmental issue.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>A sewer leak for six weeks caused the Delta Park dam in the Florence Bloom Bird Sanctuary to be fully covered by water hyacinth. This plant blocks sunlight, stopping underwater plants and small water animals from making food, which leads to less oxygen and the death of water life. The problem is serious, and Delta Park Users Group leader, Shirley Tebbutt, asked for quick help.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>Experts from the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB) and the Centre for Biological Control (CBC) stepped in to help. Researchers like Professor Julie Coetzee and Dr. Kelby English used a plan to control the plants by adding megamelus scutellaris, or hyacinth hoppers, to the dam.</p>
<p>So how did they do it?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological Control:</strong> About 25,000 hyacinth hoppers were put into the dam. These insects eat the plant's sap, causing diseases that slowly kill the hyacinth.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Strategy:</strong> This way does not work right away but plans to cut the hyacinth by 85-90% over time. The researchers will keep adding hoppers, especially in spring when the plants grow back.</li>
<li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> Shirley Tebbutt and her volunteers also try to remove the plants by hand, but the problem is too big.</li>
</ul>
