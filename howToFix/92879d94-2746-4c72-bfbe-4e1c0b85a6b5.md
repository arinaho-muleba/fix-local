## Why is river cleanup important?
Cleaning a river is important for keeping the local environment healthy and making sure the community has clean water. Pollution in rivers can harm animals, damage natural habitats, and be dangerous to people. By organising a community cleanup, you can help make the river beautiful and useful again.

## How to organise a river cleanup with your community
**Things you need:**  
- Rubbish bags: For collecting litter and debris.
- Gloves: To protect hands while picking up trash.
- Safety gear: Like goggles and masks to keep you safe.
- First aid kit: For any minor injuries during the cleanup.

**Tools required:**  
- Grabbers or tongs: To pick up trash without direct contact.
- Nets: For collecting debris from the water.
- Buckets: For sorting recyclables and non-recyclables.
- Signs: To guide volunteers and inform the public about the cleanup.

**Steps to organise a river cleanup:**

1. **Plan the event:** Choose a date and time for the cleanup and identify the specific area of the river that needs attention.

2. **Gather volunteers:** Ask people in your community, local groups, and schools to join your team.

3. **Get permissions:** Talk to local authorities to get any permits you need for the cleanup.

4. **Promote the event:** Use social media, flyers, and community boards to tell people and get them to join.

5. **Prepare supplies:** Make sure you have all the necessary materials and tools ready for the day of the cleanup.

6. **Conduct the cleanup:** On the day of the event, organise volunteers into groups, distribute supplies, and start cleaning the river area.

7. **Throw away waste properly:** Sort the waste into recyclables and non-recyclables and throw them away as per local rules.

8. **Celebrate and teach:** After the cleanup, thank the volunteers and teach the community why keeping the river clean is important.
