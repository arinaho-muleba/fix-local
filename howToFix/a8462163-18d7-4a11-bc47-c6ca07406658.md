# Understanding the 3 types of readings on your water and electricity bill
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/a8462163-18d7-4a11-bc47-c6ca07406658/images/a8462163-18d7-4a11-bc47-c6ca07406658.webp)

Water and electricity bills can be confusing and frustrating for many South Africans. It's important to know the types of readings on your bill to make sure you only pay for what you use.

## Types of readings and how to handle them

1. **Estimated readings:**
   - These are worked out using a formula instead of real meter readings. If your bill seems wrong, compare it with your meter and raise a billing query with your municipality.

2. **Actual readings:**
   - These should show the real use as recorded by a meter reader or sent by a smart meter. Mistakes can happen if the meter is broken or if readings are recorded wrong. If you have trouble disputing these readings, write down your attempts and make a formal complaint.

3. **Deemed readings:**
   - Used when a meter is faulty or missing, these are guesses based on past use. Check the calculation method with your municipality to make sure it is fair and correct.

## More information
For more help, follow the steps given by your municipality if you have billing problems.
