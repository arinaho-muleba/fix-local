## Why community-installed floodlights are important
Floodlights put up by people in the community help keep parks safe and bright at night. They help stop crime and let people use the park after dark. If a floodlight breaks, it's important to fix it quickly to keep the park safe and useful.

## Steps to fix a floodlight

**Materials and tools needed:**
- Replacement bulb: Make sure it matches the type of the existing floodlight.
- Screwdriver: For opening the floodlight casing.
- Ladder: To safely reach the floodlight.
- Safety gear: Gloves and goggles for protection.
- Voltage tester: To make sure there is no electricity before starting repairs.

**Procedure:**

1. **Safety first:** Make sure the power to the floodlight is off. Use a voltage tester to check there is no electricity.

2. **Reach the floodlight:** Use a ladder to get to the floodlight safely. Make sure the ladder is stable.

3. **Open the casing:** Use a screwdriver to take out the screws and open the floodlight casing.

4. **Replace the bulb:** Take out the old bulb and put in a new one that matches the type needed.

5. **Check connections:** Look at the wires and connections for any damage. Tighten any loose connections.

6. **Close the casing:** Put the casing back and secure it with the screws.

7. **Test the floodlight:** Turn the power back on and check if the floodlight works properly.
