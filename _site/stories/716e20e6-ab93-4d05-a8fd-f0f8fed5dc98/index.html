<p>People living in Parkmore are dealing with damaged roads because of leaking pipe in one of their roads. They are taking action to support the city of Joburg's backlog.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>A water leak on Holt Street in Parkmore is worrying locals. Joburg Water changed a broken pipe two months ago, but the pipe has continued to leak. This caused damage to the road surface. Cars driving over the unfixed part broke the pipe again, leading to more water leaking and bigger holes in the road developing. This is dangerous for drivers and pedestrians.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>Residents Susan Kemp and Ronald Ncube decided to fix the problem themselves. They filled the holes with stones and sand to make the road usable and channeled the leaking water to the pavement. Kemp reported the problem to Ward 90 councillor Martin Williams, who has promised to make it a priority with the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA).</p>
