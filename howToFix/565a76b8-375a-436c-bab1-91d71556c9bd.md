## Steps to fix broken gym equipment

### Check the problem
- **Small problems:** If you see a loose bolt or screw, use a simple toolkit to tighten it.
- **Cleaning:** If the equipment is dirty or a bit rusty, use a cloth with rust remover or oil to clean it.

### Do not do big repairs
- **Hard problems:** Do not try to fix broken parts, damaged parts, or electrical problems. These need professional help and could be dangerous if not handled correctly.

### Report the problem
- **Tell the right people:** Let your local council or park managers know about the problem. Give specific details about the equipment and where it is to help with quick repairs.

### Temporary safety steps
- **Warn others:** If the equipment is not safe, do not use it and put a clear sign to warn others until it is fixed.

## Things you need for small fixes
- **Toolkit:** Have a screwdriver and a wrench that can change size.
- **Cleaning things:** Have a cloth, rust remover, and oil ready.

Remember, keeping yourself and others safe is important. If you're not sure, it's best to report the issue and wait for professional help.
