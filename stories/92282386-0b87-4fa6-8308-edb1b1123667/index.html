<p>In Limpopo, school kids are helping to protect their environment by checking the water quality of local rivers. This project is part of a bigger plan to teach and empower communities about saving water.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Water is a limited and important resource in South Africa, and its quality is often harmed by pollution from farms and bad sewage systems. In some areas, poor management and theft have made water shortages worse, leaving communities struggling to get clean water. This situation poses big health risks and threatens the sustainability of local water sources.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>The University of the Western Cape (UWC) started a project called &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Our Feet&quot; to solve these problems. This project trains community members as &quot;citizen scientists&quot; who, in turn, teach school kids how to check water quality. The project focuses on the Hout Catchment area and includes more than 200 learners from local schools.</p>
<p>The children learn to use freshwater test kits and the Stream Assessment Scoring System (SASS) to check water health. They collect information on phosphates, nitrates, and invertebrate diversity, which is then shared with global platforms like EarthWatch Europe and the United Nations SDG 6.3 water portal.</p>
<p>The project aims to teach people about saving water and give the next generation the knowledge to protect their environment. By including local communities, the project helps people connect more with their natural surroundings.</p>
