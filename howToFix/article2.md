## Understanding prepaid meter error codes

Prepaid meters might show error codes because of problems like connection issues, using too much power, or entering the wrong token. Luckily, you can fix many of these errors without calling Eskom or a technician.

### Common error codes and solutions

- **Keypad error (….30…., Conn-FAIL, or E07):**  
  This error means there's a problem between your keypad and the meter. To fix it, plug the keypad into the nearest electrical outlet to the meter. Make sure all switches are off except the one for the device. Check the keypad batteries and reset the meter by pressing **i**, **BLUE**, or **#**.

- **Connection wait error (ConnEct):**  
  This means the keypad is trying to connect to the meter. Wait up to 30 minutes for the connection to work.

- **Token used error (USED):**  
  This error means the token entered has already been used. Type in a new token or buy another one.

- **Load error (OUEr_Por):**  
  This happens when too many appliances are using power. Turn off all appliances for 30 minutes to reset the meter and think about using fewer appliances at the same time or upgrading your power supply.

- **Active error (NOT_Act):**  
  This means the meter is inactive. Type in the token **55555** to turn it on.

- **Initialisation error (E01):**  
  This means the meter hasn't been set up. Type in the token 1275 4194 1448 6450 5970 to turn it on.

- **Lockout error (Loct-oUT):**  
  This happens when the meter locks out because of too much power use. Wait for the message to clear and use fewer appliances.

- **Low meter battery:**  
  Replace the batteries in your meter.

- **Technical problem:**  
  If your meter shows a technical problem, call Eskom at 0860 Eskom.

- **CIU not paired:**  
  Type your meter's serial number on the keypad to connect it with the external meter.

- **Invalid token (rEjEct):**  
  This means an invalid or unauthenticated token. Call Eskom at 08600 eskom for help.
