                <h1>How to fix a fallen tree</h1>

<p><em>Report before you fix:</em> <em>Have you already tried to report the problem? Reporting the problem is important so we can make our local government give us services that our taxes pay for. If not, click here to learn how to report it or escalate it.</em></p>
<h2>Checking the situation</h2>
<p>When you find a fallen tree, first look at the situation carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate dangers:</strong> See if the tree is caught in power lines, blocking a busy road, or could hurt people or property. If any of these are true, don't try to handle the tree yourself. Call local emergency services at 10111 (South African emergency number).</li>
<li><strong>Size and location:</strong> Think about how big the tree is and where it has fallen. If it is large, near a building, or on a slope, it might be too risky to handle alone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to call for professional help</h2>
<p>If the tree is not an immediate danger and you feel you can handle it, you can try, but be careful. If you are unsure about your safety, it's best to call professionals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to call for professional help:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The tree is caught in power lines.</li>
<li>The tree is too big or heavy to move safely.</li>
<li>The tree is leaning on a building or car.</li>
<li>You don't have the right tools or experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For professional help, contact a good tree removal service in your area. Many South African towns also offer emergency services for fallen trees.</p>
<h2>Getting tools and safety gear</h2>
<p>If you decide to go ahead, make sure you have the right tools and safety gear.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety gear:</strong> You need gloves, safety goggles, a hard hat, and strong boots. If using a chainsaw, also wear ear protection and chainsaw chaps.</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> You might need a chainsaw, handsaw, axe, ropes, and maybe a ladder, depending on the situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clearing the area</h2>
<p>Before you start, make sure the area around the fallen tree is clear of people, pets, and things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block off the area:</strong> Use cones, tape, or other markers to keep people away from the work zone.</li>
<li><strong>Tell your neighbours:</strong> If the tree has fallen near a shared or public space, let your neighbours or nearby people know.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planning your cuts</h2>
<p>If using a chainsaw or handsaw, plan your cuts carefully to stop the tree or branches from moving in a way that could cause injury or damage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with smaller branches:</strong> Cut off smaller branches and debris first to make the larger parts easier to handle.</li>
<li><strong>Cut the trunk in sections:</strong> For large trunks, cut them into smaller sections, starting from the top and working down.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Removing the tree</h2>
<p>Once the smaller parts are cleared, you can start removing the main trunk.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use ropes for stability:</strong> If the tree is unstable, tie it with ropes before cutting.</li>
<li><strong>Cut into manageable pieces:</strong> Keep cutting the trunk into sections that are easy to move.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cleaning up</h2>
<p>After cutting the tree, you need to clean up the leftover branches and leaves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check local rules:</strong> Some towns have special rules for getting rid of a lot of garden waste. You might need to call your local town office to find out where to take the debris or if they can collect it for you.</li>
<li><strong>Think about recycling:</strong> If possible, recycle the wood by turning it into firewood, mulch, or even furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When not to try DIY removal</h2>
<p>There are times when you should never try to remove a fallen tree yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power lines:</strong> If the tree is touching or near power lines, don't try to remove it. Contact Eskom or your local power provider right away.</li>
<li><strong>Structural danger:</strong> If the tree is leaning on a house, fence, or any other structure, leave it to professionals. The risk of more damage or injury is too high.</li>
<li><strong>Inexperience:</strong> If you are not confident in using tools like chainsaws or handling large, heavy objects, itï¿½s best to hire a professional.</li>
