*Report before you fix:* *Have you already tried to report the problem? Reporting the problem is important so we can make our local government give us services that our taxes pay for. If not, click here to learn how to report it or escalate it.*

## Understanding road surface hazards
Bad road surfaces can happen because of bad weather, lots of traffic, and not enough care. These problems can cause cracks, potholes, and other dangers for cars and people walking. Quick repairs are important to keep everyone safe and stop things from getting worse.

## Skills and expertise required
Fixing a bad road surface is not usually a job for someone without skills. It needs knowledge of building roads, skill with tools, and following safety rules. A group is best, with at least three to five people to handle machines, traffic, and repairs well.

## Tools and materials needed
- **Materials:**
  - Asphalt patch or concrete mix (depending on the surface type)
  - Aggregates (gravel or stone) for reinforcement
  - Asphalt binder to secure the patch
  - Cold patch asphalt for quick repairs
  - Asphalt sealant to protect against water damage

- **Tools:**
  - Road roller or compactor (a heavy vehicle like a bakkie can also work)
  - Shovels, rakes, brooms
  - Safety gear: Reflective vests, gloves, goggles, masks, and helmets
  - Safety cones for ensuring safety during repairs

## Steps to repair a bad road surface
1. Mark the damaged area with chalk or spray paint.
2. Clear away all loose debris.
3. Level the surface as much as possible.
4. Avoid using concrete on tar roads.
5. Apply a primer tar coat.
6. Use a bitumen emulsion for extra bonding.
7. Add another layer of tar or asphalt patch.
8. Compact the area with a compactor or a heavy vehicle.
9. Apply a sealant to stop water from getting in.

## Adaptation for Gauteng
- **Climate considerations:** Plan repairs when it's dry because Gauteng has rain in summer. High temperatures can affect asphalt pliability, so work during cooler times of the day.
- **Socio-economic factors:** Limited money may make it hard to get good materials. Community involvement is crucial, especially in areas with limited municipal services.
- **Local laws and permits:** Get the permits you need, like a "Wayleave," for public road repairs. Make sure you follow the National Road Traffic Act and local rules.

## Reporting and community involvement
- **Report your issue:** Make sure the problem is reported to local authorities for proper attention.
- **Community initiatives:** Think about joining or starting community groups like a street WhatsApp group, residents' association, or community policing forum (CPF) to stay informed and involved.
