<p>Makhanda, which used to be called Grahamstown, is dealing with a big water problem, leaving many people without water for days. The community and the disaster relief group Gift of the Givers are stepping up to help with the urgent need for water.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Many parts of Makhanda have had no water for more than a week because of issues with the water supply system. The high dirt levels in the Orange/Fish river supply caused the James Kleynhans Water Treatment Works to stop, affecting the eastern part of the city. The problem is made worse by low water levels in Settlers Dam and surprise power cuts. Residents have been waiting for hours to get water from city trucks, which have had trouble meeting the need.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>To help with the crisis, Gift of the Givers is bringing truckloads of bottled water to Makhanda. The group is also sending Dr. Gideon Groenewald, an expert in water and rocks, to work with the city to find long-term water solutions. At the same time, local group Makana Revive has been helping with giving out water. Vehicles from nearby municipalities and Rhodes University have also been delivering water to affected areas. Gift of the Givers has put a lot of resources into drought help, like drilling boreholes and giving bottled water.</p>
