# Citizen scientists fight sewage leaks in South Africa

Leaking sewage systems are a big threat to South Africa's freshwater. A group of dedicated citizen scientists in KwaZulu-Natal is showing how community involvement can help tackle this environmental crisis.


## What was the problem?
Sewage leaks pollute South Africa's freshwater, posing a big risk to public health and the environment. Reports from the Department of Water and Sanitation show that many sewage treatment plants fail, causing untreated wastewater to enter rivers and dams. This causes severe pollution, like the cholera outbreak in Hammanskraal in 2023, and harms water bodies like the Hartebeestpoort Dam.


## How did they solve it?
In 2009, young, unemployed residents from Mpophomeni became "Enviro-Champs" to fight the sewage crisis. The Duzi uMngeni Conservation Trust and the Mgungundlovu District Municipality supported this initiative, helping them monitor and report environmental hazards. They used tools like clarity tubes and a special mobile app to record sewage spills and other problems, giving real-time data to local authorities.

By 2016, the Enviro-Champs stopped sewage leaks from 104 manholes. Their work grew, and now 1,000 Enviro-Champs are active across KwaZulu-Natal, with help from different organizations and funding from the Presidential Employment Stimulus and Social Employment Fund.
