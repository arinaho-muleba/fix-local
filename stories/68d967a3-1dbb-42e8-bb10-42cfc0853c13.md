# Bhekuzulu youth fix drainage problems

In Bhekuzulu, young people are fixing drainage problems themselves, showing how strong community action can be.

  
## What was the problem?  
Bhekuzulu has had ongoing storm-water drainage problems, especially on the taxi route to Mpofini. Blocked drains cause bad smells and road damage, and the municipality has not responded to reports. Residents are frustrated because local authorities have done little to help.

  
## How did they solve it?  
To solve the problem, Bhekuzulu's youth organised a clean-up to clear the blocked drains. With cleaning tools, they worked hard to stop more road damage. Mkhuliseli Mhlongo from the Salvation Army praised the volunteers and said the municipality should help remove the debris.

Siyanqoba Sibiya, a young volunteer, said they are proud and plan to improve road signs and markings with help from private donations. He said it's important to find new ways to solve service problems instead of protesting.

After the clean-up, municipal workers helped remove the debris, which was a small win for the community.
