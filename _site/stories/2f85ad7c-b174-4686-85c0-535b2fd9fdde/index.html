<p>Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo (JCPZ) is making parks safer for women and girls. Find out how their new Environmental Enforcement Unit is making parks safer across the city.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Even though parks are designed for relaxation and fun times, women often feel unsafe, especially when they are alone. Research shows that women are more likely than men to feel unsafe in parks, especially after dark. This safety worry stops women from fully enjoying these public spaces.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>To fix these safety worries, JCPZ started the Environmental Enforcement Unit (EEU), a team of trained field rangers. This unit, made up of 37 rangers and 15 interns from the South African Biodiversity Institute, works closely with local police to keep parks safe. The EEU is there to enforce park rules and make parks safe for everyone. JCPZ encourages women to visit parks with friends and family, saying parks should be for everyone.</p>
