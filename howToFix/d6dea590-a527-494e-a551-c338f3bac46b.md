Creating a WhatsApp group helps bring people together for a common purpose. It allows for easy communication with many people in one place.

## Steps for setting up your WhatsApp group

1. **Choose the type of group:**
   - Decide if you want a closed group where only the Admin can post, or an open group where everyone can chat.

2. **Create the group:**
   - Open WhatsApp and start a new chat.
   - Select "New Group."
   - Pick contacts from your phone to add to the group.
   - Name your group and click "Create."

3. **Invite members:**
   - You can have up to 1,024 members in a group.
   - As an Admin, you can invite people by creating a link, even if they are not in your contacts. Be careful, as this link can be shared, letting others join without direct approval.

4. **Set up a WhatsApp community (optional):**
   - If you expect many people, think about making a WhatsApp community. This allows for up to 50 groups within a community, accommodating up to 5,000 members.
   - In community groups, only Admins can post, which keeps messages on topic.

5. **Privacy considerations:**
   - In communities, members can hide their contact details, visible only to Admins. In regular groups, all members can see each other's numbers.

6. **Legal considerations:**
   - The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) applies to business groups, and you need consent to add members. For private groups, you don't need consent, but members should be able to leave easily.
