## Checking the situation

When you see a fallen tree, first look at the situation carefully.

- **Immediate dangers:** See if the tree is caught in power lines, blocking a busy road, or could hurt people or property. If any of these are true, don't try to handle the tree yourself. Call local emergency services at 10111 (South African emergency number).
- **Size and location:** Think about how big the tree is and where it has fallen. If it is big, near a building, or on a slope, it might be too risky to handle alone.

## Deciding whether to continue

If the tree is not dangerous and you think you can handle it, you can continue carefully. But if you are unsure about your safety, it's best to call professionals.

- **When to call a professional:**
  - The tree is caught in power lines.
  - The tree is too big or heavy to move safely.
  - The tree is leaning on a building or car.
  - You don't have the right tools or experience.

For professional help, contact a good tree removal service in your area. Many South African towns also offer emergency services for fallen trees.

## Getting tools and safety gear

If you decide to go ahead, make sure you have the right tools and safety gear.

- **Safety gear:** Important items include gloves, safety goggles, a hard hat, and strong boots. If using a chainsaw, also wear ear protection and chainsaw chaps.
- **Tools:** You might need a chainsaw, handsaw, axe, ropes, and maybe a ladder, depending on the situation.

## Clearing the area

Before you start, make sure the area around the fallen tree is clear of people, pets, and obstacles.

- **Block off the area:** Use cones, tape, or other markers to keep people away from the work zone.
- **Inform neighbors:** If the tree has fallen near a shared or public space, tell your neighbors or nearby pedestrians.

## Planning your cuts

If using a chainsaw or handsaw, plan your cuts carefully to avoid unexpected movement of the tree or branches.

- **Start with smaller branches:** Remove smaller branches and debris first to make the larger parts easier to handle.
- **Cut the trunk in sections:** For large trunks, cut them into smaller sections, starting from the top and working downwards.

## Taking away the tree

Once the smaller sections are cleared, you can start removing the main trunk.

- **Use ropes for stability:** If the tree is unstable, secure it with ropes before cutting.
- **Cut into manageable pieces:** Keep cutting the trunk into sections that are easy to move.

## Taking the sticks and leave away

After cutting the tree, you need to dispose of the debris properly.

- **Check local rules:** Some towns have specific rules for getting rid of large amounts of green waste. You might need to contact your local town office for collection or take the debris to a designated disposal site.
- **Think about recycling:** If possible, recycle the wood by turning it into firewood, mulch, or even furniture.

## When not to try DIY removal

There are certain situations where you should never try to remove a fallen tree yourself:

- **Power lines:** If the tree is touching or near power lines, do not try to remove it. Contact Eskom or your local power provider immediately.
- **Structural danger:** If the tree is leaning on a house, fence, or any other structure, leave it to professionals. The risk of more damage or injury is too high.
- **Inexperience:** If you are not confident in using tools like chainsaws or handling large, heavy objects, it’s best to hire a professional.
