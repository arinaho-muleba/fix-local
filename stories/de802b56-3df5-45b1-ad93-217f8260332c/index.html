<p>The Amanzimtoti Community Police Forum (ACPF) has taken a big step in fighting crime by getting a new car from the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>The ACPF has been busy with community safety projects, attending many meetings and events in Amanzimtoti. But they had issues because they used private cars and had few police resources, which slowed them down.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government helped by giving a car to the ACPF. This is part of a bigger government plan to give 85 cars, worth R30 million, to community police forums in the area. The new car will help the ACPF move around and work better, so they can respond to crime faster and support community safety.</p>
<p>The ACPF chairperson, Merlene Matthew, expressed gratitude for the donation, highlighting its importance in promoting safety and security in the community. The car will be important in speeding up crime-fighting and supporting the hard work of ACPF members.</p>
<p>KwaZulu-Natal Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube said the government is committed to helping local crime-fighting projects and working together to stop crime. By giving community groups important resources, the government wants to strengthen local solutions and community actions.</p>
