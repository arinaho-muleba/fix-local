# Warner Beach South neighbourhood watch makes community safer

In Warner Beach South, a neighbourhood watch group is working hard to make the area safer with a camera network.

  
## What was the problem?  
Warner Beach South struggled to keep crime prevention going all the time. At first, street patrollers were used, but they couldn't be there all the time, showing the need for a better system.

  
## How did they solve it?  
The Warner Beach South Neighbourhood Watch (WBSNW) set up a camera system. Led by chairperson Norman Lavery and deputy chairperson Craig Upton, the project placed 46 cameras around the area. These cameras are on main roads and other important spots to cover the area and take clear pictures, even at night. Emergency services and community groups can see the live feed from these cameras, which helps them respond quickly.

The project also worked with local businesses, like Helluvafast Motorcycles and Dunlop Tyre shops, to host cameras and give free Wi-Fi. This community-funded effort allows WBSNW members watch the cameras, with each volunteer spending about 30 minutes a month. The main goal is to get more members and watch the cameras all the time, making sure all entry and exit points are always monitored.

  
## Join the effort  
To learn more, sign up, or volunteer to watch the cameras, visit the WBSNW website at [www.wbsnw.co.za](http://www.wbsnw.co.za) and fill out the form.
