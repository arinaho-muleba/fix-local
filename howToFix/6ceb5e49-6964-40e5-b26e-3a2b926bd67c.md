## Understanding the rat problem in public spaces
Rats often cause problems in public areas because they are drawn to food waste and places to hide. They can spread diseases and damage buildings. To manage rats well, you need to know how they behave and where they like to live.

## What to do
**Things you need:**  
- **Rodent bait stations:** Use these to safely put out poison or traps.
- **Snap traps:** Use these to catch rats quickly.
- **Rodenticide:** Be careful and follow local rules when using this.
- **Protective gear:** Wear gloves and masks to stay safe.
- **Waste bins with lids:** Use these to keep food away from rats.
- **Cleaning supplies:** Use these to keep areas clean and keep rats away.

**What to do:**  

1. **Find where rats live:** Look for signs like droppings or bite marks.

2. **Keep food safe:** Make sure bins have lids and are emptied often.

3. **Put bait stations in busy rat areas:** Keep them away from children and pets.

4. **Place snap traps along walls or in dark corners where rats move.**

5. **Use rodenticide carefully:** Follow safety rules and local laws.

6. **Keep areas clean:** Regularly clean to remove food and places where rats can nest.

7. **Check traps and bait stations often:** Change your plan if needed.
