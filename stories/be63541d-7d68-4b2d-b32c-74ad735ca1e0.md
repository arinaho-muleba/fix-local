# Innovative pest control Alexandra

![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/be63541d-7d68-4b2d-b32c-74ad735ca1e0/images/be63541d-7d68-4b2d-b32c-74ad735ca1e0.webp)

  
In Alexandra, a place with a big rat problem, there's a new plan to make pest control fun. People are being encouraged to deal with the rat issue directly, with the promise of a cellphone for those who catch enough rats.

  
## What was the problem?  
Alexandra is dealing with a serious rat problem. The rats are damaging property and are a health risk to people. The area has leaking sewage, thrown-away food, and too many people, which makes it easy for rats to live. The problem is so bad that people often talk about rats and are more afraid of them.

  
## How did they solve it?  
To fight the rat problem, a local NGO, Lifeline, started a reward program with the help of cellphone company 8ta. The plan gives people a cellphone if they catch 60 rats. This plan makes catching rats a group effort. People like William Malothane and Joseph Mothapo are taking part and showing their catches. The initiative not only helps reduce the rat population but also raises awareness about the issue.

So how did they do it?
- People use traps with leftover food to catch rats.
- Lifeline writes down the details of people to find areas with the worst rat problems.
- The plan also uses fumigation and brings in natural hunters like owls to control the rats.
- The plan teaches people to change their ideas about owls and to waste less food that attracts rats.
