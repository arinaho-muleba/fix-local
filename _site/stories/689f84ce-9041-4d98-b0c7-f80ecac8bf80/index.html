<p>The Nelson Mandela Bridge in Johannesburg has been improved a lot, making it safer and more beautiful as part of a bigger city clean-up effort.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>The Nelson Mandela Bridge, an important link between Braamfontein and Newtown, had become a place where crime happened often because of bad lighting and broken parts. The bridge's bad condition was not only unsafe for people walking and driving but also made it less of a symbol of unity in Johannesburg.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>The City of Johannesburg, working with the Jozi My Jozi movement and business partners, started a big fix-up of the bridge. They put in new LED and solar lights, paid for by Absa and the Maharishi Invincibility Institute. They also cleaned graffiti, replaced broken glass panels, and made the bridge safer.</p>
<p>So how did they do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>They put in new lights to make it easier to see and stop crime.</li>
<li>They cleaned graffiti and replaced 81 broken glass panels, with help from PG Glass, FNB, and Govenderï¿½s Aluminium &amp; Glass.</li>
<li>The Johannesburg police increased patrols to keep the bridge safe and stop more damage.</li>
<li>This project is part of a bigger city clean-up for Mandela Day and includes the &quot;Adopt a Project&quot; plan to help with social problems like homelessness.</li>
</ul>
