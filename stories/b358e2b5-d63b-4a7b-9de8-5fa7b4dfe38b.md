# Harrismith's water warriors

![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/b358e2b5-d63b-4a7b-9de8-5fa7b4dfe38b/images/b358e2b5-d63b-4a7b-9de8-5fa7b4dfe38b.webp)

Harrismith had a big problem when its taps were dry for six months, leaving people without water. The Maluti-A-Phofung municipality, already under management, couldn't fix the problem quickly. The community was stressed, and something needed to be done fast.

A group of residents, led by Sam Twala, decided to take action. They formed the Harrismith Water Heroes, a volunteer group focused on fixing the town's water system. Instead of protesting, they chose to act. With help from municipal officials, they checked the water system and installed a pump to get water from the nearby Sterkfontein Dam. In four days, water flowed again, but with low pressure.

The group didn't stop there. They worked on other service delivery issues, like fixing roads, cleaning the town, and sorting out sewerage problems. Even though they faced criticism and challenges, they stayed committed to their work. The municipality offered them money, but they said no to avoid problems over money.

The group has spent a lot of resources on their projects, even using government money to bring back electricity in a local suburb. Despite some setbacks, they continue their work with no plans to stop.
