## Understanding the issue of overgrown grass
Keeping the grass on verges and in parks neat is important for looks as well as safety. Tall grass can block views on corners, which can be dangerous for drivers and people walking. It can also hide pests and make public areas look messy.

## Steps to manage overgrown grass

**Materials and tools needed:**  
- Lawn Mower: For cutting the grass to a good height.
- Weed eater: To tidy the edges along paths and curbs.
- Pruning Shears: For cutting any branches or bushes hanging over.
- Rake: To gather cut grass and leaves.
- Rubbish Bags: For throwing away grass clippings and leaves.
- Safety Gear: Gloves, goggles, and ear protection.



**Procedure:**  

1. Look at the area to see how much the grass has grown and if there are any obstacles.
2. Cut the grass with a lawn mower to a good height.
3. Cut any branches or bushes hanging over with pruning shears.
4. Use a weed eater to tidy the edges along paths and curbs.
5. Rake the cut grass and put it in bags to throw away. Take these bags to your local municipal dump.
