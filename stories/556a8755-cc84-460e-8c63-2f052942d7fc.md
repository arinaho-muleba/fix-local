# Adopt-a-traffic light plan fights load shedding
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/556a8755-cc84-460e-8c63-2f052942d7fc/images/556a8755-cc84-460e-8c63-2f052942d7fc.webp)

Load shedding in South Africa causes big traffic problems, especially at busy intersections. The R21 and Nellmapius Drive intersection often had traffic jams during power cuts, which were unsafe and frustrating for drivers.

Hollard Insure, with the City of Tshwane and other partners, connected the traffic lights at the R21 and Nellmapius Drive intersection to backup power from the Route 21 Office Park. This project is part of the City's adopt-a-light programme, which asks businesses and communities to help keep traffic lights working.

The project started to keep traffic lights working during load shedding, which helps reduce traffic and make roads safer. Tshwane Mayor Cilliers Brink praised the teamwork, saying it helps traffic flow better and makes roads safer.

The success of this project inspired other businesses, like MacRobert Incorporated Attorneys, to adopt traffic lights in other areas, helping with traffic problems during power cuts.
