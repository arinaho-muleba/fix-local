# Owls to catch rats in Alexandra

Johannesburg is using nature to fix the rat problem in Alexandra township. The city is bringing in owls to naturally reduce the number of rats.

  
## What was the problem?  
Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg, has many big rats, some as big as cats. These pests have been a problem for residents, who have struggled to find ways to control the infestation.

  
## How did they solve it?  
Johannesburg started the Owl Box Project, a three-year plan to use owls to control the rat numbers. The project works with EcoSolutions and also uses rat cages and fumigation.

The city teaches local communities and schools about how owls help control rats and addresses myths that link owls to witchcraft. Three schools in Alexandra—Zenzeleni Primary, Iphuteng Primary, and Minerva Secondary—are actively participating in the project. Owl nesting and release boxes have been installed at these schools, giving students hands-on learning experiences about the ecological role of owls.

To involve the community more, chosen students feed the owls for the first 21 days with food from EcoSolutions. The city is also urging residents to avoid using poisonous pest control substances, as these can harm the owls if they eat poisoned rats.

Nonceba Molwele, head of health and social development in Johannesburg, says prevention is important in controlling rats. She highlights the need for community cooperation to get rid of conditions that allow rats to thrive, such as illegal dumping and improper waste disposal.
