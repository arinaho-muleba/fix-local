# Norwood’s community policing success
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/c40754a2-8dff-44d4-9998-66e5aa5945c5/images/c40754a2-8dff-44d4-9998-66e5aa5945c5.webp)

  
In Norwood, the local police and the Community Policing Forum (CPF) worked together to reduce crime, showing how effective community involvement can be.

  
## What was the problem?  
Norwood had many issues, like high crime, empty buildings taken over by homeless people, and people on the streets committing crimes. The community struggled with these problems, made worse by homeless camps along main roads.

  
## How did they solve it?  
Colonel Logan Govender based at Norwood's police station, developed different plans to fight crime. The police increased fines and held weekly meetings with security companies to better handle crime. The station's efforts have been recognized, with an improvement in its rating.

Larry Marks, the acting chairman, led the Community Policing Forum to connect the community and the police. The forum worked to make sure the police provided the services the community needed. Beverly Finger led the Community in Blue (CIB) team to work on social projects to make the area safer, like securing empty substations.

going form strength to strengths, the CPF still faces challenges, like needing more community help and more money to do more work.
