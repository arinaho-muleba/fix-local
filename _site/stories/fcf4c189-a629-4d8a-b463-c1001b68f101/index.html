<p>The theft of overhead cables in South Africa has caused big problems and worries about the environment. A new plan is now here to deal with this issue.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Transnet has had a big problem with over 1,000 kilometers of overhead cables being stolen in 2021. This theft has messed up services and made people think about using diesel engines instead of electric ones, which could hurt the environment. It's hard to prove where stolen cables come from, so groups of thieves can keep stealing without getting caught. Only a few thieves ever get punished.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>A new invention from South Africa offers a way to fix this big problem. The method marks the top two-thirds of overhead rail cables with nickel microdots, using a slow-moving train. These microdots, also used for cars, can't be removed and are hard to change. This idea makes it risky for scrap yards to buy stolen cables, as the microdots help catch and convict thieves. Because of this, the illegal copper market should get much smaller, and even shipments to other countries can be tracked.</p>
<p>CableDNA is the company that came up with this new way to stop theft, making copper theft too risky. More information can be found at <a href="https://www.cabledna.co.za/">www.cabledna.co.za</a>.</p>
