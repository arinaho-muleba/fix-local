# The unifying power of sports in the Cape Flats

![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/3c01209e-cad2-47cf-8aef-108774d382a2/images/3c01209e-cad2-47cf-8aef-108774d382a2.webp)

  
In a world often split by differences, sports bring people together, closing cultural and social gaps. The Cape Flats recently saw this power through a sports event that united the community.

  
## What was the problem?  
The Cape Flats, an area with many social and money problems, often struggles with division and lack of community unity. These issues show the need for projects that can bring people together and help them understand each other.

  
## How did they solve it?  
The WPDI Peace Through Sports programme, supported by NBA Africa, organised a sports event in May at a newly fixed-up basketball court in the Cape Flats. This event showed unity, bringing players and fans from across the community. The programme focused on values like teamwork, fair play, and respect, using basketball to teach these important life skills.

So how did they do it?
- The event had basketball games and activities that showed the importance of sportsmanship and working together.
- NBA Africa's involvement helped spread the programme's main values, using basketball's universal appeal.
- Participants, like Amos Tyiki, were thankful for the training they received and hoped to become world-class athletes.
- Fans helped make the event a success, and their excitement showed the collective spirit sports can inspire.

The Peace Through Sports programme is a sign of hope, showing how sports can bring positive change and promote peace and reconciliation. It reminds us that sports are not just about competition but also about fostering mutual respect and inclusion.
