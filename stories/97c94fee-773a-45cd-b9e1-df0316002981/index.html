<p>Kroonstad, in the Free State, had big problems with its services. A group of local business people decided to fix things themselves, changing the town and bringing back community pride.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>Kroonstad had bad roads, broken robots, and pavements that were hard to use. The municipal swimming pool had been closed for over five years, and the town's condition was getting worse. People were losing hope, and they needed to act fast to bring the town back to life.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>In 2016, a group of local business leaders started the Ignite and Revive Kroonstad movement. They began with simple clean-ups, which slowly brought back hope and pride among the people. They fixed potholes and pavements and reopened the municipal swimming pool.</p>
<p>The group worked closely with the local government, which supported their 'adopt a traffic circle' plan, giving the town's entry points a much-needed facelift. Their hard work led to Kroonstad winning the Kw�la Town of the Year award in 2022, showing how dedicated the people are.</p>
<p>So how did they do it?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community Clean-Ups:</strong> Started with simple clean-ups to boost morale and pride.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Repairs:</strong> Included road and pavement repairs and the reopening of the municipal swimming pool.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration with Municipality:</strong> Partnered with the local government, which supported their 'adopt a traffic circle' plan.</li>
<li><strong>Business Support and Volunteers:</strong> Got funding from businesses and mobilized volunteers to keep the town clean and appealing.</li>
<li><strong>Job Creation:</strong> They created about 250 jobs and more chances through SETA-sponsored positions, keeping young people in the area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ignite and Revive Kroonstad is now encouraging other towns in the province to take similar action. The movement is a sign of hope, showing the power of community-led actions.</p>
<p>Local businessman John Smith said, &quot;Seeing our town come back to life is incredible. It's amazing what we can do when we work together.&quot;</p>
<h2>Getting together to take action</h2>
<p>Do you have a community group like a ratepayers association in your area? A well-run group of committed people can work better with local government. Go to the link below to find out how.</p>
