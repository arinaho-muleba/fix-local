The Vala Zonke project is getting more support from the provincial government and local councils. This project aims to fix potholes and make roads safer, with help from community members who care about Mahikeng.

How did they do it?
- People like Abednigo Shebi use things like broken bricks and cement to fill potholes.
- Young people in the community are working hard to fix roads and earn money for their families.
- The Vala Zonke project brings the government and local people together to fix the problem.
