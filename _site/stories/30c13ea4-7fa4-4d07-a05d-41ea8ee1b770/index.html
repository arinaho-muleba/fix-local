<p>Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo (JCPZ) is taking action on community worries about dangerous trees to keep people safe.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>People living in Auckland Park were worried about big, leaning trees at the corner of Fawley Avenue and Lothbury Road. These trees leaned on each other and a fence, making them very dangerous. A big old tree at the corner of Molesey Avenue and Cookham Road was dangerous for more than a year because its branches could fall on homes and buildings. In Melville, a big tree trunk on Main Road near 6th Avenue worried people because it was close to a homeless camp and fires were made at its base.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>Residents continuously reported issues with dangerous trees to JCPZ , who then began to actively fix these problems. They started cutting branches at Fawley Avenue and Lothbury Road and plan to finish by the end of July. They removed the dangerous tree at Molesey Avenue and Cookham Road, so it is no longer a threat. In Melville, they are working to remove the tree trunk and plan to use a grab truck to do it. Even with equipment problems, JCPZ is working hard to fix these issues quickly.</p>
<p>Jenny Moodley, JCPZ's spokesperson, said it is important for people to keep reporting tree problems. She said there might be delays during busy times, but keeping people in Johannesburg safe is a priority for the city.</p>
