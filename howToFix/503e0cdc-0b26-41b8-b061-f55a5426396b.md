## Understanding informal dumping spots
Informal dumping spots are places where people throw away waste without using the right methods. These are often found on street corners or at the edges of townships. When there are not enough waste collection services, people might throw rubbish in open spaces nearby. This makes the area look bad and can cause health problems and harm the environment.

## Steps to deal with a rubbish pile

**Materials needed:**  
- Rubbish bags: For collecting and containing waste.
- Gloves: To protect your hands while handling waste.
- Masks: To protect against dust and smells.
- Cleaning tools: Such as brooms and shovels for gathering loose debris.

**Safety precautions:**  
- Wear protective clothing to avoid contact with hazardous materials.
- Keep a first aid kit nearby in case of injuries.

**Steps to clean up a rubbish pile:**

1. **Look at the pile:** Check how big the pile is and what kind of waste it has. This helps you plan the cleanup and find any dangerous materials.

2. **Get a team:** Ask people in your community or volunteers to help with the cleanup. More people make the task easier and quicker.

3. **Sort the waste:** Separate things that can be recycled from those that cannot. This helps with proper disposal and recycling.

4. **Collect and bag the waste:** Put the waste in rubbish bags and make sure everything is inside the bags.

5. **Contact local waste services:** Ask local waste services to pick up the rubbish you collected.

6. **Stop future dumping:** Put up signs to stop dumping and talk to local authorities to make waste collection better.
