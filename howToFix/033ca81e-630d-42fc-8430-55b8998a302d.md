# How to manage your Eskom electricity bill with self-read meter readings
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/033ca81e-630d-42fc-8430-55b8998a302d/images/033ca81e-630d-42fc-8430-55b8998a302d.webp)

**Manage your electricity costs by sending your own meter readings to Eskom. This way, your bill shows your real usage, helping you control your energy use and save money.**

## Steps for submitting your self-read meter readings

1. **Know when to send your readings:**
   - To make sure your bill is right, send your meter readings at the right time. This is usually one to two days before your next estimated meter reading date, which you can find on your Eskom bill.

2. **Learn how to read your meter:**
   - Reading your meter is easy once you know how. Only write down the numbers to the left of the comma. If your meter has numbers in a different color, like red, do not include them in your reading.

3. **Send your readings:**
   - Use the MyEskom Customer App to send your readings with your smartphone or tablet. You can also use the Customer Service Online portal to send your readings.

4. **Check your bill for problems:**
   - Know your energy use to manage your bill well. Watch out for things that can make your bill higher, like extra charges or seasonal price changes.
