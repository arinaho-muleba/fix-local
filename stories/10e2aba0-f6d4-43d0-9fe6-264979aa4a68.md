# Helping township entrepreneurs with solar power
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/10e2aba0-f6d4-43d0-9fe6-264979aa4a68/images/10e2aba0-f6d4-43d0-9fe6-264979aa4a68.webp)

To help entrepreneurs in townships and rural areas, a new project is giving out portable solar power kits to help them start and keep their businesses going.

Many entrepreneurs in these areas struggle to get reliable power for their businesses. This lack of infrastructure stops them from making money and improving their lives.

The Community Chest, led by CEO Lorenzo Davids, introduced the EcoBoxx Entrepreneur Kits, which are portable solar power tools to help small business owners. These kits are light and include solar panels that give up to 50 hours of power. They come with important tools like LED lights, a USB fan, hair clippers, and a cellphone charging cable, allowing entrepreneurs to offer services like haircuts and mobile charging.

The project helps 963 people in the Cape Town area by giving them tools and business training. By using solar energy, these entrepreneurs can run barbershops and other businesses, possibly earning up to R1,000 per week.

The project encourages participants to find community needs and create services or products to meet them. This approach not only supports entrepreneurship but also promotes community development and safety.
