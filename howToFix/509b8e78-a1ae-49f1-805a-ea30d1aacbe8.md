## What is load Shedding?
Load shedding is when Eskom, South Africa's power company, turns off electricity on purpose to balance how much power is used and how much is available. This happens because there isn't enough electricity. It is done in stages, which show how long the power will be off. Eskom provides a schedule for these power cuts on its website and in local news, so people can plan ahead.

## Why does load shedding happen?
Load shedding happens for several reasons:

- **Old equipment:** Eskom's power plants are old and need repairs and upgrades, which affects electricity production.
- **Not enough power:** The current power supply is not enough to meet the demand.
- **Coal dependency:** Eskom relies heavily on coal power plants, which can have supply issues and cause pollution.
- **Maintenance and corruption problems:** Poor maintenance and corruption lead to frequent breakdowns and unexpected outages.
- **Workforce issues:** High absenteeism and low morale among Eskom's workers affect electricity production.
- **Financial problems:** Eskom has financial issues, including high debt and lack of funds, which stop it from upgrading and maintaining infrastructure.
- **Technical problems:** Breakdowns and technical issues at power stations can cause unexpected outages.

## Tips to deal with load shedding
To make load shedding less of a problem, try these steps:

- **Stay updated:** Regularly check Eskom's load shedding schedule to plan your activities.
- **Backup power:** Get a generator, UPS, or inverter for long power cuts.
- **Save energy:** Turn off lights and appliances you are not using and choose energy-saving devices.
- **Be prepared:** Keep candles, matches, flashlights, and batteries ready for outages.
- **Emergency readiness:** Make sure your phone is charged and have a backup way to communicate.
- **Water storage:** Store enough water for cooking and hygiene, as water supply may be affected.
- **Alternative cooking:** Use gas stoves or portable cookers during power cuts.
- **Stay warm:** Have extra blankets and warm clothing for cold weather outages.
- **Be patient:** Understand that load shedding is needed to prevent total blackouts and manage electricity use.

Load shedding is a part of life in South Africa, and being prepared can help you manage its impact effectively. By following these tips and staying informed, you can continue your daily activities with minimal disruption.
