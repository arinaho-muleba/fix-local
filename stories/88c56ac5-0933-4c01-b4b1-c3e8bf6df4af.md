# Rebuilding safe parks in Johannesburg — block by block

*In Johannesburg, a new project is changing neglected parks into lively community spaces using an unexpected tool: Minecraft.*


## What was the problem?
Johannesburg, the biggest city in South Africa, has many parks and public spaces. Many of these areas are divided and unsafe because of apartheid's history. End Street North Park in Doornfontein was especially affected, with problems like homelessness, vandalism, illegal dumping, and high crime rates. Seeing the park's bad condition, the Johannesburg Open Space Policy decided to fix it to create more fun places and better facilities.


## How did they solve it?
In December 2015, a Block by Block Workshop was held to take back End Street North Park and involve local residents in its redesign and upkeep. People used Minecraft to imagine and suggest big changes, like better benches, more street lights, improved toilets, new playgrounds, and an open-air gym. This new way encouraged community involvement and care for the space.

So how did they do it?
- **Community workshops:** Residents joined workshops using Minecraft to plan park improvements.
- **High-impact changes:** Suggestions included better benches, more lights, improved toilets, new playgrounds, and an open-air gym.
- **Public space check:** They mapped public spaces in the central business district.
- **Mixed reality viewing:** Community members saw the Minecraft designs in mixed reality, using Ericsson's technology.
- **Ongoing management:** The project team works with city leaders to make sure the park is used and maintained.

> “If we mainstream this kind of co-creation, public participation, and urban communication, we are going to get public ownership of cities. This is exactly the kind of thing I will be looking at in the future.” — Cristo Botes, Johannesburg Development Agency

> “Community engagement is really important to ensure that the spaces that we build are high quality, needed, and maintained afterwards.” — Pontus Westerberg, UN-Habitat
