<p>In South Africa, new technology helps schools save water and money. By using smart water meters, schools cut down on water waste and save millions of Rands.</p>
<h2>What was the problem?</h2>
<p>During the big drought in Cape Town in 2017, schools had high water bills and wasted water because of hidden leaks. Checking water use with monthly bills wasn't enough to stop water loss and money issues in time.</p>
<h2>How did they solve it?</h2>
<p>A test project put smart water meters in four Western Cape schools, giving detailed, hourly water use data. This helped schools quickly find leaks and change how they use water. The success of this project led to its growth to 345 schools in 2018, saving a lot of water.</p>
<p>So how did they do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart water meters, made by Bridgiot, were put in to give real-time water use data.</li>
<li>Shoprite and the Western Cape government paid for fixing leaks and burst pipes.</li>
<li>Experts from the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University ran tests to encourage water-saving habits with information campaigns and competitions.</li>
<li>Schools got weekly updates on their water use, with some joining competitions to further motivate conservation efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results were impressive, with schools cutting water use by up to 26%. The project not only saved water but also showed the chance for big money savings, with a return on investment estimated at R1.5 billion if used across the country.</p>
