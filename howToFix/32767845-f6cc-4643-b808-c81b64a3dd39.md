## Understanding potholes
Potholes happen because of bad weather, lots of cars, and poor road care. Changes in temperature cause cracks in the road, which get worse with rain, making potholes. Unlike sinkholes, which are bigger and need experts to fix, potholes can often be fixed by people with the right materials and tools.

## Materials and tools needed
**Materials:**  
- Road repair material: To fill the pothole.
- Small stones or gravel: To make the patch stronger.
- Asphalt binder: To hold the patch together.
- Quick-fix road material: For quick fixes.
- Asphalt sealant: To stop water from getting in.
- Safety gear: Gloves, goggles, and masks to keep you safe.

**Tools:**  
- Spade: To take out bits from the pothole.
- Broom: To clear loose materials.
- Compactor (500 kg or hand): To press down the patch.
- Asphalt rake: To spread the patch evenly.
- Trowel: For smoothing the patch surface.
- Sharp cutting tool: To cut patch material to size.
- Safety cones: To keep you safe while working.

## Steps to fix a pothole

1. Mark the edge of the pothole with chalk or spray paint.
2. Take out all loose bits from the hole.
3. Make the bottom of the pothole as flat as you can.
4. Do not use concrete to fix tarred roads.
5. Put a first layer of tar in the pothole.
6. Spray a bitumen mix into the hole.
7. Add another layer of tar.
8. Use a compactor to press down the repairs.
9. Put a powder sealant to stop water from getting in.
