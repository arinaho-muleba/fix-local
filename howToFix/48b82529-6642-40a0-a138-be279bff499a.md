# Fixing illegal dumping
![Placeholder Image](https://storageforfixlocal.blob.core.windows.net/dev/content/48b82529-6642-40a0-a138-be279bff499a/images/48b82529-6642-40a0-a138-be279bff499a.webp)

Illegal dumping is a big issue that affects our communities, environment, and economy. It costs cities millions to clean up and can cause health and safety problems. By understanding the issue and taking action, we can help create cleaner, safer neighborhoods.

## Steps to address illegal dumping

1. **Recognize the problem:**
   - Illegal dumping means throwing away waste in places where it's not allowed, like household trash, construction debris, and industrial waste.
   - This practice harms the environment, lowers property values, and can cause health problems.

2. **Protect property values:**
   - Regular cleanups stop pests, blocked drains, and pollution, which can lower property values.
   - Cleaner neighborhoods are more attractive and can increase property values by up to 57%.

3. **Safeguard public health:**
   - Dump sites attract pests that spread diseases like Leptospirosis and Hantavirus.
   - Removing waste early helps stop these health problems.

4. **Prevent flooding:**
   - Litter can block drains, causing floods and damage to roads and buildings.
   - Regular waste collection and drain cleaning are essential, especially during rainy seasons.

5. **Reduce plastic pollution:**
   - A big part of illegally dumped waste is plastic.
   - Sorting and recycling waste can help the environment and create jobs.

6. **Get involved:**
   - Report illegal dumping to local authorities to make your community safer and cleaner.
   - Use the contact details to report incidents and help make your neighborhood beautiful.
