Starting a rate payers' group can make your community's voice stronger than individual efforts. These groups are important for asking for improvements and making sure local authorities in Gauteng are responsible.

## Steps to form your group

1. Decide who can join:
   - Decide if the group is open to all residents or specific groups like landowners or homeowners.
   - Think about if there will be membership fees. If so, you'll need to register the group and set up a bank account.
   - Choose the legal setup, usually as a non-profit organisation (NPO) or non-governmental organisation (NGO).
   - Write a formal set of rules and choose leaders to speak for the members.
   - Invite the community to join, either while setting up or after the group is ready.
   - Use flyers, local newspapers, or community WhatsApp groups to tell more people and grow the group.

2. Plan your first meeting by choosing a place and setting a date and time.
