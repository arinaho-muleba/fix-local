# Fighting pollution in the Jukskei River

The Jukskei River near Alexandra has a big pollution problem. Local volunteers are working hard to fix this environmental issue.

  
## What was the problem?  
The Jukskei River is very polluted because people dump household waste and building rubble illegally, especially near the Stjwetla informal settlement. Even though the media has talked about it before, the problem continues. Informal housing on unsuitable land makes it worse. Illegal dumping by nearby residents is a big problem.

  
## How did they solve it?  
Paul Maluleke leads the Alexandra Water Warriors in cleaning the river. They work with the City of Johannesburg and the Johannesburg metro police to make the riverbanks safer. The NGO is hiring 50 patrollers to stop illegal dumping and guide people to legal landfill sites. They also plan to set up a recycling station to cut down on waste going into the river.

Mark McClue, CEO of Action for Responsible Management of Our Rivers, has been working with Maluleke for six years to keep the river clean. Their efforts have turned the river into a valuable environmental asset for the community. The Water Warriors have also started a litter trap project to catch debris before it flows downstream.

Illegal dumping and building work still cause big problems, like flood risks during the rainy season. Everyone needs to work together to find long-term ways to manage waste.
